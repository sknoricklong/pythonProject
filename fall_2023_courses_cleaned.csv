The cumulative effects commonly erode of the quality of liberal democracies -- and sometimes trigger their eventual collapse. Meanwhile authoritarian states have commonly become even more repressive at home and emboldened abroad, challenging Western alliances and the rules-based world order. Part I in this course opens by discussing the concept, classification, and measurement of democratic and authoritarian regimes, and reviews evidence of trends. Part II debates multiple explanations for these developments. This includes (i) accounts focusing upon the rise of specific strongman leaders and elite enablers; (ii) falling electoral support for moderate parties, party system fragmentation, and the growing popularity of authoritarian-populist parties; (iii) the spread of misinformation and disinformation in the digital age; (iv) legal-institutional design flaws failing to check executive aggrandizement; (v) structural drivers and economic inequality in mass society; (vi) the impact of nativism, population migration, and growing ethnic and racial diversity; (vii) new electoral cleavages due to cultural shifts in social values; and (viii) global struggles in international relations pitting Western allies against the forces of authoritarian states. Part III considers the practical policy options flowing from each alternative theory. The course adopts a global comparative perspective, including the United States, using cross-national time series data and selected case studies of the process. Assignments include a regional workgroup mid-term report and a final individual research report.

Students will be introduced to the basic science of climate change, including the radiation budget of the Earth, the carbon cycle, and the physics and chemistry of the oceans and atmosphere. We will look at reconstructions of climate change through Earth history to provide a context for thinking about present and future changes. We will take a critical look at climate models used to predict climate change in the future, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses, evaluating which forecasts of climate change impacts are robust, and which are more speculative. We will spend particular time discussing sea level rise and extreme weather (including hurricanes, heat waves, and floods). We will look at the complex interactions between climate and human society, including climate impacts on agriculture and the relationship between climate change, migration and conflict. We will also discuss strategies for adapting to climate change impacts, and the implications of those strategies for sub-national and international equity. The last half of the class will consider what to do about climate change. First, we will review the recent history of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as various national and international efforts to limit them in the future. We will discuss reducing carbon emissions using forestry, agriculture and land use, and then focus on how to transform the world’s energy system to eliminate CO2 emissions. We will conclude by examining different strategies for accelerating changes in our energy systems to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The course is intended as a foundational course on climate change for students from around the university, preparing them for more specialized courses in their individual concentrations or degree programs. No prerequisites are required; students will be encouraged to apply their different preparations and interests to the various individual and group assignments.

No other students are allowed to enroll at this time. The course is in response to longstanding efforts by HKS students, and most recently, the HKS Equity Coalition, to insist that understanding race and racism and their intersecting forms of power and oppression is essential to an excellent education at a policy school. The United States’ global dominance has long been the envy of the world. But the role of race to native born and newcomer alike has often been treated as aberrational, an unfortunate artifact of the nation’s past. This course disrupts this vision by examining the nature of race at the heart of the American project.

No other students are allowed to enroll at this time. The course is in response to longstanding efforts by HKS students, and most recently, the HKS Equity Coalition, to insist that understanding race and racism and their intersecting forms of power and oppression is essential to an excellent education at a policy school. The United States’ global dominance has long been the envy of the world. But the role of race to native born and newcomer alike has often been treated as aberrational, an unfortunate artifact of the nation’s past. This course disrupts this vision by examining the nature of race at the heart of the American project.

On the background of European integration and the workings of EU politics, the course particularly focuses on the EU’s international affairs; Europe in regional and global security; the EU’s foreign, security, and defense policy; and various issues related to Europe’s search for its role and place in twenty-first world politics. Topics to be covered will include the causes, drivers, and hindrances of European integration and the EU’s foreign, security, and defense policies; matters of Europe as part of the north Atlantic world and transatlantic relations; issues of the EU becoming an international political actor; dealing with an assertive Russia and its war in Ukraine; China’s rise, the evolving U.S.-China rivalry, and its implications for Europe. Additional topics may include examining research on differences and similarities among North America and Europe, and North Americans and Europeans; different views and claims of “civilian,” “normative,” and “market” power Europe; and various topics of recent crises and crisis politics in Europe (such as Covid, Brexit, EMU/Euro, or migration). The course concludes with taking stock and looking ahead regarding possible futures, scenarios, key policy challenges, and the possible roles that Europe may or may not play in the twenty-first century world politics to come. The course syllabus combines several “classic” statements on European politics and international affairs with some of the most interesting recent statements, including a number or particularly pertinent original documents and texts; scholarly articles; as well as policy and opinion pieces. Course activities include seminar-style discussions; brief student presentations of their reviews and critiques of the readings; student presentations on (immediate) policy options and or (longer-term) policy strategies along with seminar discussions of these; brief rounds of joint (policy or other) brainstorming; and a number of presentations or short lectures by the course provider.",https://portal.my.harvard.edu/psp/hrvihprd/EMPLOYEE/EMPL/h/?tab=HU_CLASS_SEARCH&SearchReqJSON=%7B%22PageNumber%22%3A1%2C%22PageSize%22%3A%22%22%2C%22SortOrder%22%3A%5B%22SCORE%22%5D%2C%22Facets%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22Category%22%3A%22HU_SCL_SCHEDULED_BRACKETED_COURSES%22%2C%22SearchPropertiesInResults%22%3Atrue%2C%22FacetsInResults%22%3Atrue%2C%22SaveRecent%22%3Afalse%2C%22TopN%22%3A%22%22%2C%22ExcludeBracketed%22%3Atrue%2C%22SearchText%22%3A%22(%20(STRM%3A2238)%20(ACAD_CAREER%3A%5C%22HKS%5C%22)%20(ACAD_ORG%3A%5C%22GOV%5C%22)%20)%20(%20Ulrich Krotz %20)%22%2C%22DeepLink%22%3Afalse%7D,,

This will include the normative analysis of change (applying various concepts of well-being, efficiency, social justice and poverty), the application of economic concepts (to the interpretation of household and firm behavior, strategic interactions and economy-wide patterns), and the role of political, governmental and social behavior in shaping the possibilities for, drivers of and resistance to change. This will be undertaken through a mixture of discussion of overall patterns backed by a strong focus on case studies in particular country settings. Examples of topics are education, health, economic growth, the management of financial crises, pension reform, managing common property resources, international migration, community development, the design of decentralization and corporate structure.

The first portion of the course provides students with a broad, historical survey of Islam, including its origins, central institutions, and its religious, social, legal, and political approaches. In exploring Islam’s journey outside the Arabian Peninsula, the first part of the course will prioritize its focus on Islam’s complex ethnic and cultural diversity. This portion of the course will culminate with exploring Islam’s venture into US soil and consequently the effect of this on the American political and public sphere. The second portion of the course involves introducing students to the various political theories of governance in Islam and exploring how Islam as a faith tradition becomes political when seeking to address key policy issues confronting state and society. Major themes for this section include the questions surrounding the separation of church and state in Islam, political Islam, and what exactly is an “Islamic state”. Students will be required to post responses to readings. The final portion of this course will be devoted to social and legal challenges to changes in Muslim societies. Students will gain knowledge of what constitutes success and failure in working for democratic reform and change in Muslim-majority contexts. Students will complete a final paper of their own design where they propose a solution to a particular policy challenge as it relates to addressing a social, legal, global, or political issue for a majority Muslim population context.

But is corruption really on the rise? Which countries are the most corrupt? Do highly corrupt countries share any common characteristics that we can identify and perhaps mitigate? Corruption clearly has social costs ranging from diversion of funds for public programs to undermining of public trust in government. Yet, few recent attempts to fight corruption have succeeded. Challenges of bad governance, high levels of corruption and low levels of accountability persist. Moreover, it remains an open question whether all countries – particularly those with large informal economies – would be better off if all corruption were somehow eradicated. This course explores these questions, as well as related policy issues, such as electoral fraud, turnout suppression, the role of information and transparency on improving governance and accountability, and anti-corruption strategies.

Indeed large scale, irregular human migration should be considered “the new normal”, not an unexpected or one-off “crisis”. It affects the lives of millions, unsettles established governments, creates sharply polarizing policy dilemmas and generates far-reaching administrative, economic and political challenges. This course will focus on distress migration, including refugee flight and other forms of forced displacement, evaluated through the lens of human rights. It will address the multifaceted drivers of the phenomenon, including the enduring legacies of colonization, armed conflict, environmental stress and climate change, global inequality, demographic pressures and increasing globalization. The course will also consider the impact of government responses to the COVID 19 pandemic on forced migrants. Migration actors from UN agencies, NGOs and other civil society organizations, and research experts working in a range of field sites will contribute to the class. The course will address the legal frameworks governing migration, and the ethical and pragmatic considerations that influence policies. It will explore the viability of a range of solutions to current migration challenges, including unequal access to protection, the failure of equitable resettlement and the erosion of host empathy/solidarity. The extent to which pandemic related measures conform to or violate legal and ethical obligations will also be considered. A key goal is to enable students to analyze current migration situations with clarity and rigor concerning the obligations of states and the rights of migrants. Using examples of large-scale contemporary population movements – the Ukrainian war and its human impact, the ongoing Tigrayan emergency, the Rohingya exodus, the Venezuelan context, the Mediterranean migration situation, extensive intra-regional mobility within the African continent, US/Mexico/Central American movements, unaccompanied child migration in many regions – the course will examine migration drivers, policy responses and rights challenges such as exclusion and denial of protection, persistent racism in border control, detention, prolonged confinement within refugee camps and forced repatriation. It will also engage with the multiple risks, including statelessness, trafficking, drowning, sexual violence, that migrants face before, during and after their journeys. The course will cover key current policy developments, at the municipal, national, regional and international level, including the impact of Global Compacts on Refugees and on Migration. The course will discuss seasonal migration, child migration, undocumented and irregular status, gender factors in migration and the role of xenophobia in driving policy.

Survivors and their advocates frequently turn to current administrations, seeking recognition and reparations for wrongdoings that governments in the past were involved in.

For example, because people remember the past differently; because they question their responsibility for remedying past wrongs; or because public officials are reluctant to accept responsibility on behalf of the state because of legal, financial, political, and other concerns. This course examines the strategic challenges of reckoning with history. It offers frameworks that help diagnose “living history” to understand how groups (choose to) remember the past. It also focuses on concrete measures that are intended to come to terms with the past, which survivors might seek and which government officials may offer— from official apologies to financial reparations, and from removing or erecting monuments to civic curriculum reform.

Designed for professionals from diverse backgrounds and cultures, the course builds upon the extraordinary experience of many of our students. The purpose of the course is to increase one’s capacity to lead with and without authority, across boundaries, and from any political or organizational position.
 

 In a world in which most organizations, communities, and societies face enormous adaptive pressures, the practice of leadership is critical – the practice of mobilizing systems of people to thrive in changing and challenging times. In this course, we apply theory to practice, clarifying the relationship among key concepts – leadership, management, authority, power, influence, followership, citizenship – to provide a practical and coherent theoretical framework. We develop both diagnostic tools for analyzing the complexity of change in social systems, and strategies of action. These action strategies include: using authority and power wisely, mobilizing responsibility across boundaries, managing economies of attention, generating innovation, building trust, orchestrating multi-party conflict, regulating disequilibrium, refashioning narratives to both build and depart from history, and building a culture of adaptability for the long-term.

City and town governments constantly have the potential to change policies with massive impact on this enormous population's lives. Preparing for climate change, providing housing to the growing urban population, and keeping the businesses driving urban economies working are all examples of challenges facing these governments. Yet national politics gets the majority of attention -- from the media, from researchers, from voters, and even from public policy students -- instead of the less flashy work of governing and policymaking that happens in local governments. As a result, local governments are often under-equipped to understand the policy solutions available to them to address these challenges. Nor are they usually equipped to confront the often-contentious politics of public opinion and engagement required to actually implement these solutions. This course is an experiential learning lab in which students work in teams on political challenges facing real-world local government clients. Project teams will partner with local cities and towns, or departments of larger government entities, to address policy challenges such as transportation, the impacts of climate change, affordable housing, and other current topics. The projects vary in policy area focus, but all allow students to apply skills learned in HKS classes to real-world policy settings, and in turn provide tangible benefits to partner cities and towns. Project teams will use a variety of skills, but will almost all incorporate original public opinion polling of city residents to assess the political viability of policy solutions. In advance of team project-based work, the course includes training in advanced relevant analytical skills, such as GIS mapping, data visualization, and survey measurement and design. Project work and technical skills-based learning are complemented by sessions discussing current academic research on relevant urban policy issues. Extensive field work outside of class time will be required, including multiple visits to client sites by student team members.

Centering an intersectional framework and historical critique of “progress,” we will focus our attention on the interrelationship between protest (how LGBTQ+ people have come out and organized themselves), politics (how LGBTQ+ people have confronted and navigated the “culture wars”), and policy (how LGBTQ+ people have challenged and shaped laws and legislation) from the Homophile Generation (1940s and 1950s) to the Stonewall Generation (1960s and 1970s) to the AIDS Generation (1980s and 1990s) to the Marriage Generation (2000s and 2010s) and beyond. We will explore significant movement moments, examine a diverse range of change agents, and analyze specific legal and legislative inflection points. Ongoing and targeted discrimination against LGBTQ+ people is a pressing modern phenomenon, yet too often it is altogether ignored or treated as an afterthought in discussions and debates about human rights, social justice, law and public policy—despite the fact that such practices of prejudice and abuses of power continue to perpetuate stigma and perpetrate violence against queer people in myriad ways. The modern LGBTQ+ movement in the United States offers some vital lessons about the long and contested struggle over representation and rights, assimilation and acceptance, and equity and liberation.

Designed for professionals from diverse backgrounds and cultures, the course builds upon the extraordinary experience of many of our students. The purpose of the course is to increase one’s capacity to lead with and without authority, across boundaries, and from any political or organizational position. 
 

 In a world in which most organizations, communities, and societies face enormous adaptive pressures, the practice of leadership is critical – the practice of mobilizing systems of people to thrive in changing and challenging times. In this course, we apply theory to practice, clarifying the relationship among key concepts – leadership, management, authority, power, influence, followership, citizenship – to provide a practical and coherent theoretical framework. We develop both diagnostic tools for analyzing the complexity of change in social systems, and strategies of action. These action strategies include: using authority and power wisely, mobilizing responsibility across boundaries, managing economies of attention, generating innovation, building trust, orchestrating multi-party conflict, regulating disequilibrium, refashioning narratives to both build and depart from history, and building a culture of adaptability for the long-term.

Technological innovation is all around us, and new possibilities in fields like artificial intelligence, genome-editing and geoengineering not only reallocate power, but might transform human life itself considerably, to the point of modifying the essence of what it is to be human. While ethical considerations enter prominently, the philosophy of technology is broader than its ethics. It aims to interpret and critically assess the role of technology for human life and guide us to a more thoughtful integration of technology in our individual lives and in public decision making. This course aims to teach you to do just that, starting with basic stances and key figures in the field and then progressing towards a number of challenges around specific types of technology as they arise for the 21st century. At times it is tech optimism that dominates these debates (sometimes even techno-boosterism that sees technology as key to heaven on earth), at other times it is more low-spirited attitudes from romantic uneasiness to doom-and-gloom Luddism and technology-bashing. A closer look at these attitudes – alongside reflection on how technology and power are intertwined -- will help generate a more skeptical attitude towards all of them and contribute to more level-headed debates, which is badly needed.

In recent years there’s been an explosion of interest over the role that moral leadership ought to play in the public sphere, due in no small part to the perceived lack of it in so many people wielding political power. But what is moral leadership, exactly? Ask a dozen people and you’ll get a dozen different answers. This new course approaches this question not by offering another theory of leadership—“moral leadership”—but by exploring how moral practice can inform, complement, and most importantly improve all sorts of good public leadership. For our purposes, moral practice will be understood as just that—a practice, specifically, a set of exercises, activities, and methods, all of which involve the cultivation of moral perception, moral imagination, and moral character, and all of which are directed towards improved moral action in the public sphere. To help us with this task, we will explore cross-cultural philosophical traditions, ancient as well as contemporary, to learn about this conception of ethics, understood not merely as a set of intellectual doctrines—not merely as a kind of thinking or reasoning—but as an entire ethos—as a way of life. Philosophy will therefore be the engine driving this course, but a kind of philosophy rescued from many of its current academic manifestations. As a bonus, students will come to learn how several of the most popular notions in leadership studies—purpose, character, authenticity, happiness and more—have their roots in philosophy. These roots are worth examining. This course therefore pioneers a new approach to professional ethics—one that aims to tether much more closely action to thought—and it will deploy a variety of tools to accomplish its aims, from the “usual suspects”—cases, simulations, film and other forms of fiction—to new experiential exercises. Students will come away with insight into their own ethos, strategies on how to continue to develop it (a lifelong pursuit), and models on how to have it deeply inform their own public leadership practice.",https://portal.my.harvard.edu/psp/hrvihprd/EMPLOYEE/EMPL/h/?tab=HU_CLASS_SEARCH&SearchReqJSON=%7B%22PageNumber%22%3A1%2C%22PageSize%22%3A%22%22%2C%22SortOrder%22%3A%5B%22SCORE%22%5D%2C%22Facets%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22Category%22%3A%22HU_SCL_SCHEDULED_BRACKETED_COURSES%22%2C%22SearchPropertiesInResults%22%3Atrue%2C%22FacetsInResults%22%3Atrue%2C%22SaveRecent%22%3Afalse%2C%22TopN%22%3A%22%22%2C%22ExcludeBracketed%22%3Atrue%2C%22SearchText%22%3A%22(%20(STRM%3A2238)%20(ACAD_CAREER%3A%5C%22HKS%5C%22)%20(ACAD_ORG%3A%5C%22GOV%5C%22)%20)%20(%20Christopher Robichaud %20)%22%2C%22DeepLink%22%3Afalse%7D,4.58,2.94

These worries have continued and evolved as the technology of communication has been seen as a technology of surveillance. The modern world of computers, cell phones, CCTV-camera, and the emerging Internet of Things offer unprecedented opportunities for tracking everything everyone does. At the same time, policy around the right to privacy and indeed the definition of what privacy means have evolved in different ways in different countries. European laws attempt to protect the privacy of the individual from corporations, while U.S. law tries to protect the privacy of the individual from the government. Corporations doing business in multiple jurisdictions find themselves subject to conflicting and sometimes contradictory rules and regulations, while users find it difficult to know what rights they have with respect to their interactions. This course will look at the state of both policy and technology surrounding privacy. Is the technology capable of the kinds of panopticon-style surveillance that critics worry about? What laws cover the use and abuse of such technology, both in the United States and abroad? What is meant by privacy, and how can it be preserved in the face of ongoing technology? And how can nation-states regulate the gathering, access, and use of the information we generate with our technology to preserve some sense of privacy and autonomy? How does an individual’s right to privacy balance against the requirements of security or public health? Most of all, what problems have a technological solution, and what problems require oversight and policy changes?

This course takes a range of themes to interpret contemporary China’s actions in the world, and understand how China’s history can explain important aspects of contemporary policy and decision-making. The course takes key themes and examines them in both contemporary and historical context. Among the themes explored are: China’s role in international organizations including the United Nations, influence in shaping regional and global norms and patterns on trade and technology, military expansion, action on climate change, development of identity as a leader of the Global South, and promotion of new forms of ideology. The course will examine ways that China conforms and embraces some aspects of the current global order, and confronts or revises others, including its relationships with the US, the Global South, and areas of cross-border concern (such as climate change or technological norms). We will examine the changing nature of China’s global thinking in the twenty-first century, and provide comparisons and contrasts with a range of historical events that have shaped that thinking, such as the conflicts with European empires in the late 19th century, the development of new forms of reformist and revolutionary political thinking in the early 20th century including ideas on class, ethnicity and gender, China’s war against Japan in the 1930s and 1940, and the revolutionary turmoil of the era Mao Zedong in 1949-76.

Ongoing debates about religion, politics, identity, and rights make it clear that religion is one of the most powerful forces in public life today. This course is designed to help students identify and unpack the myriad competing political commitments and policy proposals made by religious groups as well as assess the impacts of public policy on diverse religious actors. Together, we will examine the role of religion in shaping American civic engagement and policymaking from the 17th century to the present, aiming to put contemporary events in broader historical context. In addition to reading from scholarly texts, we will consult a wide variety of primary sources, including newspaper articles, letters, speeches, survey data, and legal documents. A key aim of this course will be to disrupt common assumptions about the relationship between religion and politics so that we can better understand the current state of affairs. Thus, we will be guided by the following questions: how can we understand the political and policy claims made by different religious groups? How can we—as individuals and as a society—manage the competing claims and commitments of different groups? And how can we act in our various capacities to live in accordance with our own values, beliefs, and commitments, however defined? We will spend the first few weeks of the semester getting a better understanding of the history of religion and politics in the United States and the current religious, political, and policy landscape. We will then move to an examination of the role played by religious beliefs and actors in policymaking in specific areas including labor, immigration and citizenship, economics, social welfare, the penal system, foreign policy, education, and the environment. While many of our discussions will focus on federal policy, we will also look at the impact of religious ideas and actors on policy at the state and local levels and consider the disparate impacts of policies on individuals and groups.",https://portal.my.harvard.edu/psp/hrvihprd/EMPLOYEE/EMPL/h/?tab=HU_CLASS_SEARCH&SearchReqJSON=%7B%22PageNumber%22%3A1%2C%22PageSize%22%3A%22%22%2C%22SortOrder%22%3A%5B%22SCORE%22%5D%2C%22Facets%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22Category%22%3A%22HU_SCL_SCHEDULED_BRACKETED_COURSES%22%2C%22SearchPropertiesInResults%22%3Atrue%2C%22FacetsInResults%22%3Atrue%2C%22SaveRecent%22%3Afalse%2C%22TopN%22%3A%22%22%2C%22ExcludeBracketed%22%3Atrue%2C%22SearchText%22%3A%22(%20(STRM%3A2238)%20(ACAD_CAREER%3A%5C%22HKS%5C%22)%20(ACAD_ORG%3A%5C%22GOV%5C%22)%20)%20(%20Carleigh Beriont %20)%22%2C%22DeepLink%22%3Afalse%7D,4.83,3.14

When I am for myself alone, what am I? if not now, when? This course offers students an opportunity to develop their capacity to lead by asking themselves these questions at a time in their lives when it really matters and learning how to ask them of others. Public narrative is the leadership practice of translating values into action. To lead is to accept responsibility for enabling others to achieve shared purpose in the face of uncertainty. Because it engages the ""head"" and the ""heart"", narrative can instruct and inspire––teaching us not only why we should act, but moving us to act. Public narrative is a discursive process through which individuals, their communities and their nations learn to articulate shared values, construct shared identity rooted in those values, and respond mindfully to challenges by enabling others to to access hope over fear; empathy over alienation; and self-worth over self-doubt. Among the challenges to which we will learn to respond are loss, difference, power, and change. Based on a pedagogy of reflective practice, this course offers students the opportunity to work in groups and learn to craft and tell stories of self, us, and now , as well as how to use narrative to enable others to respond to real leadership challenges.

But to sustain change, human rights leaders need to expand from a narrow set of legal tactics. Recognizing that each defined “human right” was created by social movements and struggle, our focus is “how we can make a difference?” Committing our professional futures to human rights struggle requires not only moral commitment but also the sense that we are being effective and strategic in our approaches to change making. When resources are scarce and the environment unstable, where conflict with powerful interests moves from latent to actual, human rights leaders must have the capacity to think and act strategically. This is a skill that can be practiced and developed. This class will take concepts from historical and current strategists and study cases of successful campaigns to apply these principles to today’s human rights struggles. We will develop our strategic capacities by creating a team to focus on a human rights issue of importance to the team members, analyzing the nature of the issue and power imbalance, understanding the adversary, the resources and capacities of potential allies, and the terrain where we are most likely to make a difference. Teams will prioritize the targets they must affect and consider a broad repertoire of tactics most appropriate to leverage what needs to be done. We will explore social science research that is useful to the leadership task of strategizing, broaden our understanding of available tactics, use tactical mapping and other strategizing tools to construct alternative scenarios to resolve an active human rights struggle, and apply analytic frameworks that help us think through the acceptable balance between risk and success in making social change.

No other students are allowed to enroll at this time. The course is in response to longstanding efforts by HKS students, and most recently, the HKS Equity Coalition, to insist that understanding race and racism and their intersecting forms of power and oppression is essential to an excellent education at a policy school. The United States’ global dominance has long been the envy of the world. But the role of race to native born and newcomer alike has often been treated as aberrational, an unfortunate artifact of the nation’s past. This course disrupts this vision by examining the nature of race at the heart of the American project. In the first half of the course, we draw from African American, Latinx, Indigenous and Asian American history, critical race theory, and whiteness studies to offer students historical knowledge about the role that race and racism have played in wealth creation, labor force participation, political culture, social institutions, immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, and civic life. We then shift to the contemporary moment, drawing from theoretical and empirical research from the social sciences to highlight the institutions of racial domination that have helped to produce durable racial hierarchies, with specific attention to the modes through which hierarchies have been created and maintained.

The course is organized along the following broad sections: (i) a methodological overview, including analytical frameworks for understanding economic growth, factor accumulation and institutional outcomes, as well as an overview of empirical methods to evaluate policy impact; (ii) a historical overview of comparative economic development, with focus on the Industrial Revolution, the Great Divergence, and colonialism; (iii) individual determinants and returns to investment in human capital (fertility, health and education), and financial capital (credit markets, savings behavior), and constraints to factor accumulation; (iv) determinants of productivity, with emphasis on land and agriculture, the environment, resource misallocation within and across households/firms, poverty traps, learning and coordination and their impacts on productivity; (v) behavioral development and social norms; (vi) principles of economic reform, the role of institutions, the media and public service delivery.

 Psychologists and economists have joined forces to study how people process information and actually make decisions, rather than how they would make decisions if they were fully rational and selfish. This research program (behavioral economics, judgment and decision making, or behavioral science) shows how decisions deviate from “optimal” and why it matters. We explore the nature, causes, implications and applications of these limitations. The course’s main focus is on how these tendencies can inform the design and development of welfare-enhancing interventions.
 

 Objectives
 

 The Science of Behavior Change (MLD 304) has one central objective: to improve students’ abilities to design policies and interventions that improve societal well-being. It accomplishes this by focusing on how to leverage insights about human decision making to develop interventions (“nudges”). We piece add to the toolbox that standard economics provides for influencing behavior (namely, incentives and information) with the insights from behavioral science. 
 

 There are three additional, though secondary, goals for this class. First, it will help you better understand the science of how humans make judgments and decisions. We will review research on human thinking from social psychology, cognitive psychology, political science, organizational behavior, decision science, and economics (including its subfield, behavioral economics). 
 

 Second, this course aims to improve the quality of your own judgments and decisions. People are poor intuitive statisticians, meaning that when they “just think” about situations for which some data or casual observations exist, they tend to make serious inferential errors, in turn leading to systematically biased decisions. We will study some errors that are particularly important for real world problems and look for easy‐to‐implement solutions. 
 

 Third, this course aims to increase your familiarity with randomized experiments so you can be a smarter consumer of claims that interventions cause certain outcomes. The class will be suffused with randomized experiments and we will repeatedly discuss how confident one can be that intervention X causes outcome Y.

In response to specific assignments, students write Strategic Options Memos that require analyzing the challenge, assessing the current strategy, and identifying alternative strategies for protecting and advancing national interests. Assignments require strategic thinking: analyzing dynamics of issues, formulating key judgements, and developing feasible strategies.

At 2:49pm two bombs exploded in Copley Square where thousands of people were gathered to celebrate and watch that year’s marathon runners cross the finish line. The bombings produced deaths, profound injuries, destruction, and alarm in the community and across the nation. Calamities like this one, such as infrastructure failures or public health emergencies, present unique challenges for communities and complex demands on public leaders. Such events require public leaders to be both shepherds and servants of the people. To meet these moments, leaders must communicate, coordinate, execute, comfort and in other ways deliver effective leadership. In this course we will learn about the unique combination of knowledge, skills, and abilities required for leaders to effectively navigate and lead through high-stakes public crises. We will examine cases of public crises, both past and present including terrorist attacks, health crises and infrastructure failures, to learn from the perspectives of the different actors involved in these events and draw lessons from their experiences. We will differentiate between crisis and routine by developing our knowledge of the various types of crises and stakeholders. We build an understanding of the ways in which strategy, administration, execution and communication shape crisis response. We will review real-life examples and conduct simulations to better understand how leaders navigate through such circumstances and practice ethical decision making. Classes will engage in discussions with leaders across sectors who have experienced crisis response so that students can develop their own strategies for cross-sector collaboration and community-centric leadership.",https://portal.my.harvard.edu/psp/hrvihprd/EMPLOYEE/EMPL/h/?tab=HU_CLASS_SEARCH&SearchReqJSON=%7B%22PageNumber%22%3A1%2C%22PageSize%22%3A%22%22%2C%22SortOrder%22%3A%5B%22SCORE%22%5D%2C%22Facets%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22Category%22%3A%22HU_SCL_SCHEDULED_BRACKETED_COURSES%22%2C%22SearchPropertiesInResults%22%3Atrue%2C%22FacetsInResults%22%3Atrue%2C%22SaveRecent%22%3Afalse%2C%22TopN%22%3A%22%22%2C%22ExcludeBracketed%22%3Atrue%2C%22SearchText%22%3A%22(%20(STRM%3A2238)%20(ACAD_CAREER%3A%5C%22HKS%5C%22)%20(ACAD_ORG%3A%5C%22GOV%5C%22)%20)%20(%20Deval Patrick %20)%22%2C%22DeepLink%22%3Afalse%7D,4.7,3.11

110,"Bhabha, Jacqueline",IGA-342M,International and Global Affairs,Human Rights Dilemmas in Child Protection,2,Fall 2,"Bhabha, Jacqueline",T/Th,9:45 AM-11:15 AM,"A growing number of children and adolescents around the world are subjected to violence, exploitation and other forms of abuse. These harms persist despite the proliferation of international norms and structures designed to protect this population and promote its wellbeing. In many cases global transformations exacerbate rather than reduce the risks of abuse and increase the protection challenges these risks give rise to. Though each category of child protection deficit has its own characteristics and its attendant normative framework, they all share common and definable elements. An investigation of the human rights dilemmas that arise in child protection on a global scale presents, in a microcosm, a perspective on the social and political dynamics affecting some of the world's most vulnerable populations. One focus of the course is the child protection issues themselves, their genesis and impact. The other is the human rights strategies and dilemmas relevant to those (at both the individual and societal levels) charged with responding to rights violations affecting children and fulfilling public child protection obligations. In the midst of historic technological advances and significant progress in the realm of international human rights, the strategic choices and responsibilities facing leaders and others concerned with child protection are of increasing complexity and scope. A key concern of the course will be to integrate legal approaches with those developed in the health and social sciences. A recurring theme will be the evaluation of how international obligations map onto policy outcomes and how human rights mechanisms affect problems facing vulnerable children on the ground. The course will begin with a brief review of the theory and literature relating to child protection and international human rights. It will proceed with an in-depth discussion of case studies covering central aspects of child protection-child labor, child trafficking, child soldiering and child persecution. Analytic points will be derived from an investigation of specific problems, the legal frameworks relating to them, and the solutions that have been advanced to address them. Practitioners, policy makers and civil society leaders involved in child protection will join classes as guests. Also offered by the School of Public Health as GHP 553.

It complements their learning in the required curricula of HBS and HKS, aids them in selecting appropriate elective courses, and provides context for choosing and pursuing employment in the summers following the first and second years of the joint program. It also promotes the development of program cohort cohesion in the short term and professional identity in the longer run. The course, taught via the case method, will cover four modules at the heart of the intersection between business and government: (i) Creating shared value; (ii) Impact Investing; (iii) Public Private Partnerships; and (iv) Entrepreneurship at the intersection of the public and private sector. Understanding the very different dimensions of complex problems provides a basis for applying professional skills and knowledge to help resolve them.

The professional prospects for HKS students are richly diverse, but also, as a result, less structured and harder to forecast than in other fields (e.g., business, law, medicine). This module is designed to help students navigate careers fueled by aspirations to contribute to the public good, including considerations of work-life and wellbeing. With a primary focus on their next five-to-ten years, the course will help students frame their choices, explore and develop their options, and ultimately create a working plan for moving forward. Drawing on evidence from the study of professional careers and leadership journeys, work-family conflict and integration, and wellbeing, the module adopts a broader “life” perspective. The course is grounded in the premise that HKS students have agency in determining the direction of their careers. While not everything is planned and certain, self-direction is possible and is likely to be facilitated by actively exploring alternative paths. Students should be prepared for a substantial course load, with rigorous work expectations in and out of classroom. Students will read relevant academic research, conduct expert interviews, and participate in reflective and interactive exercises. Peer coaching is integral to the teaching model, which is designed to build a sense of community that we hope will last for years ahead. Course assignments and peer coaching will be adapted to accommodate the diversity of career stages among students in the class. The module is structured into three blocks: knowing yourself (e.g., aspirations, motivations, values); where are you going and how are you getting there (e.g., negotiating careers, networking, developing a leadership story); and building the resilience (e.g., wellness, work and family). Students will hear from HKS alumni, not because they have cracked-the-code, but because their leadership stories can help current students make sense of their own potential career paths. Through engagement with the course materials and relevant experts in their fields, students will develop a life and professional plan of action for the coming years.",https://portal.my.harvard.edu/psp/hrvihprd/EMPLOYEE/EMPL/h/?tab=HU_CLASS_SEARCH&SearchReqJSON=%7B%22PageNumber%22%3A1%2C%22PageSize%22%3A%22%22%2C%22SortOrder%22%3A%5B%22SCORE%22%5D%2C%22Facets%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22Category%22%3A%22HU_SCL_SCHEDULED_BRACKETED_COURSES%22%2C%22SearchPropertiesInResults%22%3Atrue%2C%22FacetsInResults%22%3Atrue%2C%22SaveRecent%22%3Afalse%2C%22TopN%22%3A%22%22%2C%22ExcludeBracketed%22%3Atrue%2C%22SearchText%22%3A%22(%20(STRM%3A2238)%20(ACAD_CAREER%3A%5C%22HKS%5C%22)%20(ACAD_ORG%3A%5C%22GOV%5C%22)%20)%20(%20Grant Freeland %20)%22%2C%22DeepLink%22%3Afalse%7D,4.66,3.11

This course introduces students to the theory and practice of negotiation by emphasizing both analytical and interpersonal skills. Analysis is important because negotiators cannot develop promising strategies without a deep understanding of the context of the situation, and the incentives, interests and alternatives of the other parties. Interpersonal skills are important because negotiation is essentially a process of communication, trust building (or breaking), and mutual persuasion. With the aid of case discussions, exercises, films and guest speakers, we will develop a set of conceptual frameworks to help students diagnose barriers to agreement and develop creative strategies to address them. Through participation in negotiation simulations, students will have the opportunity to learn how to prepare effectively, to practice communication and persuasion, and to experiment with a variety of negotiation tactics and strategies to both create and claim value. Throughout the course, students will be challenged to navigate differences in expectations, ethical and cultural norms, power, status, partisan perceptions and attitudes toward risk. We will work to understand diverse perspectives, to reassess and adapt strategies, to give other parties incentives to cooperate, to negotiate effectively as a team, to set up helpful communication processes, and to build trust across boundaries. The goal of the course is to help students be better equipped to anticipate challenges in advance, to expand their conception of ""what is possible"" in order to develop creative and wise strategies, to build sustainable coalitions to support their goals, and to gain confidence in advocating for themselves and others. Students must be available for weekly required negotiation simulation sessions.

123,"Kayden, Jerold",SUP-663,Social and Urban Policy,Land Use and Environmental Law,4,Fall,"Kayden, Jerold",TBA,TBA,"As a scarce and necessary resource, land triggers competition and conflict over its possession and use. For privately owned land, the market manages much of the competition through its familiar allocative price-setting framework. However, because one person’s use of land affects individual and collective interests of others and market mechanisms alone do not always protect or promote such interests, laws enacted by legislative bodies, administered by government agencies, and reviewed by courts have arisen to fill the gap. Encompassed in local ordinances, higher-level legislation, administrative rules, discretionary government decisions, constitutions, and judicial opinions, land use laws and environmental laws significantly shape the built and natural environment. For example, zoning’s use and density restrictions affect whether neighborhoods are demographically diverse or homogeneous, its height and setback restrictions sculpt the skyline. Environmental laws govern the extent to which land uses pollute air, water, and land, whether habitat is available for endangered species, and whether wetlands are preserved. Recently enacted laws are beginning to address the impacts of climate change, determining whether and how individuals may build or rebuild in areas vulnerable to floods, severe storms, forest fires, heat waves, and droughts. Through lectures, discussions, readings, and a written exercise, this course provides students with a working knowledge of land use laws and environmental laws, the institutions that create, implement, and review them, and the issues that swirl around them. The course distinguishes law’s method from those employed by other disciplines and fields. The role of non-lawyers, including urban planners, designers, public policymakers, developers, and community activists in influencing, drafting, and implementing land use and environmental laws, is explored. No prior legal background is assumed. Students with a legal background have found the course instructive. For pedagogical reasons, laws employed in the United States will be the main references, but comparisons with laws in other countries will be regularly made. Reading assignments are drawn from primary sources (legislation, constitutions, judicial opinions) and secondary sources (law review and journal articles, book excerpts, professional reports). A written exercise asks students to critically examine one provision of a zoning law and draft its replacement. An oral final exam will test overall fluency with the course subject matter.

Yet the overwhelming response to these public outcries is stasis. Why are some forms of collective action more effective than others? What does it take to build and sustain a successful social movement? This elective will combine aspects of a seminar and field lab course. Discussion-based lectures will provide an overview of the science of social change, examining historical and contemporary cases of social, labor, and political movements from around the world. We will cover findings that are generally viewed as well-established and questions that remain unsettled. Coursework will focus on key debates and distinctions, including: the difference between organizing and mobilizing, movement emergence, whether and how movements build sustained—as opposed to flash-in-the-pan—structures to contest power, and the role of culture, media, and technology in collective action. A second element of the course is designed as an experiential learning lab. Students will explore how course concepts work in practice by selecting an existing social movement organization (domestic or international) and analyzing a challenge its leaders face. Projects may address movement narratives, organizational structure and governance, leadership development, strategy and tactics, learning and adaptation, political contestation, power mapping, data analysis, or other issues related to the course content. A background or interest in social movements or organizing (demonstrated through prior experience or coursework such MLD-377 or MLD-378), mixed methods (API-203MB or C), or similar classes/applied work experience is recommended but not required.

127,"Meltzer, Rachel",API-505,Analysis of Policies and Institutions,Policy Analysis: A Tool for Evidence-Based Decision Making,4,Fall,"Meltzer, Rachel",TBA,TBA,"Policy analysis is problem solving. It involves making systematic comparisons across a set of alternatives to address a particular policy or planning problem, usually in the face of time and resource constraints. Typically, policy analysis is done to provide advice to a client, organization, or another decision-maker in the face of a public problem or crisis. It involves rapid response, quickly orienting yourself to new and changing topics that often are complex and controversial. How to develop doable solutions that target the core problem at hand? How to weigh the many competing trade-offs among diverse stakeholders? How to balance innovation with pragmatism? In this class we will develop strategies to address these, and other, challenges. While the course will emphasize the development of a stage-based analytical approach, we will also discuss alternative models of policy analysis and consider critical perspectives from political science, behavioral science and design fields. Based largely on case discussions, the class will explore the choices facing decision makers in the public and nonprofit sectors in the US and abroad with regard to a wide range of issues, including public health, environmental protection, urban development, transportation and infrastructure. We will also have a unit on cost benefit analysis and how to incorporate it into this analytical toolbox. We will approach CBA from a critical perspective and consider its limitations in the face of scarce information and equity concerns. This is a methods course: we will use a variety of cases to practice and become nimble in the logic and techniques behind policy analysis, rather than becoming an expert in any one subject area. Students will develop their own analyses and learn how to communicate them in written memos, oral argument, and visual presentations. The course will culminate in a team project in which students conduct a simulated policy analysis exercise on a current issue. This course is not open to MPP students.

136,"Stockard, James",SUP-661,Social and Urban Policy,Housing and Urbanization in the United States,4,Fall,"Stockard, James",TBA,TBA,"[with Jennifer Molinsky] This course examines housing as both an individual concern and an object of policy and planning. It is intended to provide those with an interest in urban policy and planning with a broad background on why housing matters and how its unique attributes give rise to certain challenges and shape how practitioners respond to them. The course first lays out a framework for understanding the roles housing plays in individuals’ lives, neighborhoods, and the metropolis. Early sessions examine the unique attributes and roles of housing, including the role of homes as constitutive of the private and domestic realms, housing as an icon and encoder of social status, housing as a commodity, and housing as a driver of urbanization and shaper of neighborhoods. The next sessions focus on housing as an object of policy, examining the early rise of public intervention into housing as a result of concerns over slums and the expansion in the 20th century of programs and policies that shaped housing markets, homeownership, and metropolitan form. We also explore problems flowing directly out of these interventions, including sprawl, concentrated poverty, housing unaffordability, and racial segregation. Finally, the course focuses on planning and policy responses to these challenges, including responses to poverty and segregation through urban renewal, public housing, fair housing laws, and participatory planning; cost-income mismatches and attempts to supply affordable housing; and land use regulation as a potential solution to the social and environmental problems of low-density, exclusionary development. The final session will touch on some of the most recent solutions to housing challenges including micro units, form-based zoning, age-friendly design, and others. Upon completion, students will have a firm grasp of housing and urban issues, a theoretical frame for understanding them, and a working knowledge of the planning and policy tools used to address these issues.

Why is populism becoming pervasive - and is there a revolt against global integration? What is the right balance between national sovereignty and international integration? Is the US equipped to sustain its role as a global leader? How does international trade affect prosperity and inequality? Should we regulate multi-national companies who move their factories to countries with lower labor standards? How should the IMF respond to financial crises in Europe and the developing world? How will the rise of China change the world system? This course uses basic economic logic to illuminate the choices - and trade-offs - faced by governments, international institutions, businesses, and citizens as the global economy evolves. Our course is based on the premise that passion without careful reason is dangerous and that reliance on solid analytics and rigorous empirical evidence will lead to a better world. Policy issues are debated in class by the professors and guest speakers, and students will participate in simulated negotiations on US climate policy and the US-China economic relationship, experiencing the issues firsthand, as well as illustrating the importance of decisions made by individual actors for the evolution of the global system.","https://portal.my.harvard.edu/psp/hrvihprd/EMPLOYEE/EMPL/h/?tab=HU_CLASS_SEARCH&SearchReqJSON=%7B%22PageNumber%22%3A1%2C%22PageSize%22%3A%22%22%2C%22SortOrder%22%3A%5B%22SCORE%22%5D%2C%22Facets%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22Category%22%3A%22HU_SCL_SCHEDULED_BRACKETED_COURSES%22%2C%22SearchPropertiesInResults%22%3Atrue%2C%22FacetsInResults%22%3Atrue%2C%22SaveRecent%22%3Afalse%2C%22TopN%22%3A%22%22%2C%22ExcludeBracketed%22%3Atrue%2C%22SearchText%22%3A%22(%20(STRM%3A2238)%20(ACAD_CAREER%3A%5C%22HKS%5C%22)%20(ACAD_ORG%3A%5C%22GOV%5C%22)%20)%20(%20Lawrence H.

It traces the growth and elaboration of North American cities in four major periods of urban history from the early European settlement to the present, with an emphasis on the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Through the study of plans, physical projects, and material conditions, Making the American City investigates specific topics, such as the downtown; homes and housing; public parks and landscapes; planned communities and civic spaces; homes and housing; transportation systems; environmental threats and disasters; the provision of infrastructure; racial and ethnic settlement patterns; slums and ghettos; bohemias and art districts; urban renewal and revitalization; gentrification; public landscapes and spaces; and suburbia in all its diversity. The objective of the course is to use history to inform the thinking and practice of contemporary designers, planners, and policy makers. Students enrolled in the course will gain a fundamental knowledge of the major events that have contributed to the form and character of modern American cities. The format of the course will be lectures and class discussions. The method of evaluation will be short student papers on projects or subjects chosen from different periods of the history of the American city. There are no prerequisites.

Students will prepare and present a major piece of written work (the required Integrated Written Project) analyzing and proposing solutions to a substantial public problem faced by a society or an institution. The goal is for joint degree students to apply in their papers the multidisciplinary techniques, methods and approaches they have studied over the previous three years, including those common in law, political science, economics, management, history, policy analysis, and ethical/moral reasoning. The class sessions will be spread out so that students can work on their outlines and drafts between sessions. Each student will present to the class several times in order to develop and revise their drafts with the benefit of peer and instructor feedback. Evaluation is based on the final paper and on class participation. Attendance is mandatory in all sessions. Please note, this is one half of a yearlong course. Students enrolled in the fall section will automatically be enrolled in the spring section. The seminar will meet several times in the fall and several in the spring.
